# Contribute to Julia_Dispatch.fm

(Last updated: {{ fill fd_mtime }})

We'd love to have your input. You can

- **write us your suggestions**.
  How should we have on (again) and why? What would you like to know?
  What do you like or dislike about the podcast (and why)?
  What other suggestions do you have?
- **help us with the organization**.
  We need to maintain a website, prepare and post-process episodes and
  million other small things.
  We organize right here on Github.
  Feel free to browse through all the issues and submit your pull requests.
- **be part of the show**.
  We're envisioning this as a podcast _for_ the community _by_ the community.
  If you have an idea for an episode (with or without guest), open a pull request.
  We'll try and help you with all the steps necessary.
  Once the recording is ready, you're own episode could end up on the podcast as well.
